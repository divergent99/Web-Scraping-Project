# Web-Scraping-Project
Web Scraping of the Top 100 Billboard Singers for the past 30 years and a detailed EDA for the Dataset

Billboard Magazine puts out a top 100 list of "singles" every year. In this homework, you will scrape Wikipedia to try to understand how the public's taste in music has evolved. You will do this by learning about the best singers and groups from each year as determined by the Billboard top 100 charts.
